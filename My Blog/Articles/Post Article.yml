        "body": "Is it a neo-noir crime drama? An epic story about surviving the Second World War?\n\n\"Five Decembers\" starts like a typical detective story in Hawaii, with a cop trying to prove himself. Then, in an instant, the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor and everything spins out of control while the protagonist keeps fighting to solve a case that grows to war-sized proportions, which he slowly uncovers as he investigates.\n\nI never imagined such a banal initial premise could grow into something this epic. If there are still detective stories left to tell, it will be hard to top \"Five Decembers\"."
